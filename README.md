🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game (Python CLI)
A simple and fun command-line Tic Tac Toe game written in Python for two players. The game randomly assigns symbols (X or O) to players and runs in the terminal until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

🧩 Features
Two-player gameplay (turn-based)

Random assignment of X and O to players

Automatic board rendering after each move

Input validation for cell availability

Win and draw detection logic

Easy-to-understand, modular code structure

🖥️ Requirements

🕹️ How to Play
The game randomly assigns X or O to each player.

Players take turns selecting a cell (1–9) corresponding to positions on the 3x3 board.

The first to align three of their marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

If the board fills with no winner, it's a draw.
